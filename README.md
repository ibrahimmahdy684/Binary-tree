# Functionalities the code performs
- Convert from breadth-first representation to depth-first representation.
- Convert from depth-first representation to breadth-first representation.
- Perform breadth-first search on a binary tree.
- Perform depth-first search on a binary tree.

# Implementation
dealt with every function as a problem.I came up with a solution to each problem with java. And, then converted this java code to MIPS.
